# Haskell LibP2P Crypto

You can execute hprotoc by doing `stack exec hprotoc`. Remember `stack exec` makes sure the environment is setup before running any command.

This means Crypto.LibP2P.Protobuf, Crypto.LibP2P.Protobuf.KeyType, Crypto.LibP2P.Protobuf.PrivateKey, Crypto.LibP2P.Protobuf.PublicKey is autogenerated. This is equivalent to the pb directory of the go implementation.
